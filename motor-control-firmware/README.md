# Motor board firmware

## Deploying on the robot
The firmware can be sent to the robot using the following command: `fab debra deploy`.
Both robots can be updated in a single command: `fab debra caprica deploy`.

Those commands require Fabric, which can be installed by running `pip install fabric`.
